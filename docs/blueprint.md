## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#3498DB), a calming yet professional hue to promote trust and focus within the interface.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECF0F1), a subtle backdrop ensuring content legibility and minimizing visual fatigue.
- Accent color: Emerald green (#2ECC71), used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements such as confirm buttons and active status indicators.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif suitable for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Crisp, line-based icons that maintain clarity without distracting from content. Use icons from a consistent set to give a unified feel to the interface.
- Prioritize a clean and structured layout, leveraging grid systems to organize schedule views and admin panels. Ensure the drag-and-drop feature feels intuitive and seamless.
- Subtle transitions and animations to indicate state changes (e.g., when appointments are dragged/dropped or when statuses update). This provides feedback without overwhelming users.
